## What is CMDS?

**CMDS (커맨드스페이스)** is a comprehensive Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system built on Obsidian, designed to transform raw information into actionable knowledge and creative outputs. It's not just a filing system—it's a living ecosystem where ideas connect, merge, develop, and share.

### Core Philosophy

1. **Knowledge as a Network**: Every note is a node in an interconnected web of knowledge
2. **Process-Driven**: Knowledge flows through distinct stages (Connect → Merge → Develop → Share)
3. **AI-Enhanced**: Integrated with multiple AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney, etc.)
4. **Output-Focused**: Knowledge exists to be transformed into tangible outputs (research, lectures, consulting, creative works)
5. **Personal yet Structured**: Flexible enough for creativity, structured enough for productivity

## The User: 구요한 (Yohan Koo)

### Professional Identity (as of 2026-04)

구요한은 **연구자가 아니라 "연구하면서 가르치는 실천가"** 로 자신을 정의합니다. 그의 시간과 에너지는 박사 논문이 아니라 사업과 교육에 쓰입니다.

- **Business Operator**: Sole proprietor of **CMDSPACE (커맨드스페이스)**, currently transitioning to a corporation. Builds products, education, and consulting services around personal knowledge management × generative AI.
- **Educator (primary role)**: Delivers corporate executive education — notably **LG 임원 교육 · LG 회장단 교육** — along with university lectures and public workshops. Teaches what he is actively researching in his own vault.
- **PhD ABD (paused)**: Completed coursework for the PhD in Educational Technology / Knowledge Management (ABD status). **Dissertation writing is currently paused.** Academic identity remains in the background; active identity is business + education.
- **Knowledge Management Practitioner-Researcher**: Researches PKM · Second Brain · Zettelkasten through a 10,000+ note Obsidian vault that functions as both lab and teaching material.
- **Generative AI Practitioner**: Works daily with Claude (Claude Code, Claude Agent SDK), ChatGPT custom GPTs, Obsidian × LLM integration, and multi-agent orchestration.
- **Creative Professional**: Newsletter (더배러), YouTube, music, digital art — all produced from the same vault.

### Four Current Focus Areas (as of 2026-04)

구요한 is currently concentrating research and teaching on four tightly interconnected axes. These are **not separate projects but one integrated experiment** on *"how the individual knowledge worker redesigns knowledge labor in the LLM era."*

1. **Obsidian-Based Personal Knowledge Management** — a 3+ year / 10,000+ note vault as the substrate of everything else.
2. **System Files Infrastructure** — total 8 system files in vault: 5 publicly deployed (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, CMDS.md, 🏛 CMDS Guide, 🏛 CMDS Head Quarter) + 3 internal-only (ANTIGRAVITY.md for Gemini, BRAIN.md / BRAIN_PROMPT.md for Gobi persona). Shared `.claude/rules/` accompanies the 5 public files at `system.cmdspace.work`.
3. **LLM Wiki Satellite Vault** — implementing Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern (Raw Sources · Wiki · Queries) in a separate `CMDS_LLM_Wiki` vault.
4. **9Yohan Multi-Agent System** — mapping 900 Divisions × historical "Yohan" figures × the 9 fruits of the Spirit into a 9-agent orchestration (kepler.map / goethe.sense / dewey.learn / bach.score / neumann.compute / baptist.prepare / mccarthy.reason / huizinga.play / calvin.advise).

These four axes are simultaneously **productized** (consulting, education), **published** (더배러 newsletter, public web), and **validated on the toughest stage**: top-level corporate education including LG executive and chairman-group training.

### Multi-Vault Ecosystem (확장 컨텍스트)

The mothership operates within a **7-vault ecosystem**, each governed by different authoring authority and purpose. All other 6 vaults branch from this mothership and reference its system files.

| Type | Vault | 멤버 | 역할 |
|------|-------|------|------|
| 🌍 Mothership | `CMDSPACE_Local_MBP` | 구요한 | 모든 vault 의 substrate |
| 🛰 Compiled Satellite | `CMDS_LLM_Wiki` | 구요한 + LLM | 학습·연구·정리 (focus axis #3) |

## Understanding User Intent

When 구요한 asks you to work with the vault, understand the context:

### Research Context
If discussing research topics:
- Frame as **applied research on PKM × LLM × agents** (not dissertation work — see `Professional Identity` · dissertation writing is currently paused).
- Default to one of the **4 current focus axes**: Obsidian PKM / System Files / LLM Wiki / 9Yohan. If the topic doesn't fit, say so explicitly.
- Reference relevant literature ([[📖 200 Literature]]) and methodological approaches ([[📖 400 Methodologies]]) as usual.
- Outputs usually become **newsletter editions, consulting decks, or teaching material** first; academic publications are secondary.

### Teaching Context
If discussing courses or lectures:
- Reference curriculum designs ([[📚 841 Curriculum]])
- Link to relevant subject expertise ([[📖 600 Specialties]])
- Consider student learning outcomes
- Think about course materials ([[📚 842 Course Development and Resources]])

### Consulting Context
If discussing client work:
- Document in meetings ([[60. Collections/63. Meetings/]])
- Connect to relevant expertise ([[📚 831 Consulting]])
- Reference applicable frameworks ([[📖 200 Literature]])
- Consider deliverables ([[📚 830 Projects]])

### Content Creation Context
If creating content:
- Identify target platform ([[📚 701 YouTube]], [[📚 802 Articles]], etc.)
- Reference source knowledge ([[📖 200 Literature]], [[📖 600 Specialties]])
- Use prompt templates ([[📚 492 Prompts]])
- Consider audience and purpose

### Knowledge Management Context
If discussing PKM system itself:
- Reference [[🏛 CMDS Guide]] for standards
- Consider [[📚 601 Knowledge Management]] best practices
- Think about Obsidian workflows ([[📚 501 Obsidian]])
- Apply Second Brain principles ([[📚 603 Second Brain]])

## Working with the CMDS System

### When Creating New Notes
1. Determine the **CMDS category** (100-900 series) based on content type
2. Use appropriate **note type** (note, meeting, curriculum, etc.)
3. Add required **properties** (type, aliases, author, date created, tags)
4. Link to relevant **index notes** (🏷)
5. Reference related **CMDS categories**
6. Create **backlinks** to related notes

### When Organizing Information
- **Connect Stage** → Capture in [[📖 100 Themes]]
- **Merge Stage** → Integrate into [[📖 200 Literature]]
- **Develop Stage** → Apply in [[📖 300 Data]] through [[📖 600 Specialties]]
- **Share Stage** → Output via [[📖 700 Creatives]] or [[📖 800 Outputs]]

### CMDS Process as Operational Verbs

The CMDS Process is also encoded as **8 slash commands** (`/connect`, `/merge`, `/develop`, `/share` + `/inbox`, `/lint`, `/query`, `/status`). This makes "이걸 connect할까, merge할까?" the first metacognitive step of every session. **Command implementation details (parameters, dialog flows, output paths) are in [[CLAUDE.md]] § "CMDS Process Command Suite".** Source files live in `90. Settings/94. Agent Settings/claude/commands/`.

### When Searching for Context
Look for relevant notes in:
1. **Index pages** (🏷) — Aggregated collections
2. **Hub pages** (🏛) — Main navigation
3. **CMDS categories** (📖, 📚) — Topical organization
4. **Daily/Weekly notes** — Temporal context
5. **Meeting notes** — Project context
6. **People notes** — Relationship context

## Guiding Principles

1. **Every note has a home**: All knowledge belongs somewhere in the 100-900 system
2. **Links create value**: Isolated notes are less useful than connected notes
3. **Process matters**: Knowledge flows through Connect → Merge → Develop → Share
4. **Output is the goal**: Knowledge exists to serve others through outputs
5. **AI is a partner**: AI tools enhance but don't replace human thinking
6. **Standards enable freedom**: Consistent structure allows creative flexibility
7. **Evolution over perfection**: The system grows and adapts continuously

---

**Remember**: CMDS is not just a filing system—it's a **thinking environment** where 구요한 develops ideas, conducts research, creates content, and serves others. When working with this vault, you're not just organizing files; you're supporting a knowledge worker's entire professional ecosystem.

**For technical implementation details, file operations, and coding guidelines, see [[CLAUDE.md]].**
